# Projectile-Calculator

# C++ Projectile Motion Calculator

This is a simple C++ program that calculates the position of a projectile over time based on user-provided initial velocity and launch angle. The program utilizes basic physics equations to simulate projectile motion.

## Features

- Computes the horizontal and vertical positions of a projectile over time.
- Allows the user to specify the initial velocity (in m/s), launch angle (in degrees), and desired horizontal distance.
- Displays a table of time, horizontal position, and vertical position.
- Terminates the simulation when the projectile reaches the specified horizontal distance.
